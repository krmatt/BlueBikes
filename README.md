# BlueBikes

### Questions I want to answer:

- Are stations adequately stocked with bikes to meet local demand?

### Tasks:

- Build a tool to request and record the data at a regular interval.
  - Particularly interested in how many bikes/ebikes are at each station over time.
- Use Pandas to read, organize, and analyze the data.
  - Understand how often stations are over/understocked.
- Predict demand at stations.
- Suggest redistribution strategies.
